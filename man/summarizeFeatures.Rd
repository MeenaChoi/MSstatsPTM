\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with columns of \code{run}, \code{feature}, and
\code{log2inty}.}

\item{method}{A string defining the summarization method. Default is
\code{"tmp"}, which applies Tukey's median polish. Other methods include
log2 of the sum of intensity (\code{"logsum"}), and mean (\code{"mean"}),
median (\code{"median"}) and max (\code{"max"}) of the log2-intensities.}
}
\value{
A tibble restoring one summarized value per MS run.

and returns one summarized value per run. Tukey's median polish is used by
default.

df <- data.frame(
  run = c("a", "a", "a", "b", "b"),
  feature = c("F1", "F2", "F3", "F1", "F3"),
  log2inty = rnorm(5))
